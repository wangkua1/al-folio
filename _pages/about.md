I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto, and Vector Institute advised by Professor [Rich Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). I spent some time at Google Brain (MTV, TOR) in 2018 hosted by [Chung-Cheng Chiu](https://ai.google/research/people/ChungChengChiu). Before that, I liked basketball a little too much that I worked with the Toronto Raptors' analysts Keith Boyarsky and Eric Khoury.  

My research projects scatter across various topics in deep learning including: generative models, semi-supervised learning, few-shot learning. 
Now I'm very interested in the idea of "uncertainty", the ability to acknowlegde one's lack of knowledge.
